---

**Respected Dr. Islam,**

We hope this message finds you well. We are Abraar Masud Nafiz and Hamim Rahman, fourth-year Software Engineering students at SUST. We are writing to formally present our research proposal on *Pathshala.ai: A Bangla Mini Language Model for Bangladeshi High School Education* and to respectfully request your guidance and supervision for this project. Due to unavoidable circumstances, our work has faced substantial delays. Despite these challenges, we have continued to refine and develop this project independently, and we are now reaching out with a deeply vested interest in your expertise and support to see this work through.

### Project Overview  
Pathshala.ai aims to provide a computationally efficient Bangla language model as a personal, offline tutor for high school students in rural Bangladesh. This offline, accessible solution is targeted to bridge educational gaps, offering AI-driven, localized learning assistance for students in classes 6-10 who may lack access to conventional tutoring. The system is designed to run on a simple Raspberry Pi setup, ensuring that rural students with minimal resources can benefit. With only 18 days remaining to complete the project, we are fully committed to advancing the work intensively in the time left and would be deeply honored by your guidance and support.

### Alignment with Your Expertise  
Your extensive work in **Natural Language Processing** (NLP), especially with **English-Bangla Neural Machine Translation** and **statistical machine translation systems**, directly aligns with our research needs for Pathshala.ai. These prior projects reflect your deep understanding of language models for Bangla, which could help guide the development of an optimized, culturally responsive language model tailored for Bangladeshi students.

Moreover, your current research on **digital privacy and security for children in the Global South** is highly relevant. This project’s long-term aim is to establish a safe, supportive AI tutor, particularly in safeguarding students’ interactions. We believe your expertise could help develop privacy-respecting practices and secure data handling, ensuring a protective digital environment for young users in rural areas.

### Future Prospects  
If feasible, we would like to explore voice-based Bangla conversations as a future addition to Pathshala.ai, further enhancing accessibility for students who may find audio input more intuitive than typing. While this remains an aspirational feature, your experience in computer vision and digital signal processing could provide foundational guidance in envisioning this functionality.

### Conclusion  
We are aware of the time constraints and the delays we are facing due to unavoidable circumstances. Nonetheless, we are highly motivated to move forward with determination and make significant strides within the remaining days. Your mentorship and insights would be invaluable, especially in these final stages, to refine the model for effective and secure use by young students.

Thank you sincerely for considering this proposal. We are more than willing to accommodate our schedule entirely to align with any guidance you can provide and would be most grateful for the opportunity to work under your supervision.

**Sincerely,**
