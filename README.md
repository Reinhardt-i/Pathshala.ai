**A Bangla Mini Language Model for specialized for Bangladeshi High School Education**

---
*This thesis involves developing a computationally efficient language model designed to serve as a personal, offline tutor for high school students in rural Bangladesh. I’ll be training it on class 6-10 curriculum materials to create an educational support system that works without internet access, using a simple setup with a Raspberry Pi, keyboard, and screen. This project aims to bridge educational gaps for students who can’t afford tutoring by providing accessible, localized AI-driven learning assistance.*
